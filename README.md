express-loggly
===================

Express middleware to send JSON formatted logs to Loggly from an Express application.  Use this logger to send all web traffic to Loggly for capture and analysis.  It uses [node-loggly](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-loggly) by nodejitsu.

Why JSON Logs?

## Install

```
npm install express-loggly --save
```

## Usage

```js
var express = require('express')
var logger  = require('express-loggly')

var app = express()

// Setup Loggly configuration
var config = {
    token: 'your-really-long-input-token',
    subdomain: 'your-loggly-subdomain',
    tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', ... 'tagN'] 
};

// Sequence of use() matters!
// Put this *after* session and bodyParser

// Use the logger
app.use(logger({ loggly: config }));
```

### Options

#### immediate

Write log line on request instead of response. This means that a  requests will
be logged even if the server crashes, but data from the response cannot be logged (like the response code).  Looks like this:

```js
app.use(logger({
  immediate: true,
  loggly: config
}));
```
